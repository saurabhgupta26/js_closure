## Scope (Where to look for things)

1. Guess the output:

```js
let firstName = "Arya";
const lastName = "Stark";
var knownAs = "no one";

console.log(window.firstName, window.lastName, window.knownAs);
output: undefined undefined no one
```

2. Guess the output:

```js
let firstName = "Arya";
const lastName = "Stark";
var knownAs = "no one";

function fullName(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(window.fullName(firstName, lastName));
output: AryaStark

```

3. Make a Execution Context Diagram for the following JS and write the output.

```js
function addOne(num){
  return num + 1;
}
var one = addOne(0);
var two = addOne(1);
console.log(one, two);
output: 1 2
```

4. Make a Execution Context Diagram for the following JS and write the output.

```js
var one = addOne(0);
function addOne(num){
  return num + 1;
}
var two = addOne(1);
console.log(one, two);
output: 1 2
```

5. Make a Execution Context Diagram for the following JS and write the output.

```js
console.log(addOne(0));
function addOne(num){
  return num + 1;
}
var two = addOne(1);
console.log(two);
output: 
1
2
```

6. Make a Execution Context Diagram for the following JS and write the output.

```js
var one = addOne(0);
const addOne = num => {
  return num + 1;
};
var two = addOne(1);
console.log(two);
output: can't reach lexical declaration
```

7. Make a Execution Context Diagram for the following JS and write the output.

```js
console.log(addOne(0));
const addOne = num => {
  return num + 1;
};
var two = addOne(1);
console.log(two);
output: can't reach lexical declaration
```

8. What will be the output of the following

```js
function isAwesome() {
  var awesome;
  if (false) {
    awesome = true;
  }
  console.log(awesome);
}
isAwesome();
Output: undefined
```

9. What will be the output of the following

```js
function isAwesome() {
  let awesome;
  if (true) {
    awesome = true;
  }
  console.log(awesome);
}
isAwesome();
Output: true
```

10. What will be the output of the following

```js
function isAwesome() {
  let awesome;
  if (false) {
    awesome = true;
  }
  console.log(awesome);
}
isAwesome();
Output: undefined
```

11. What will be the output of the following

```js
let firstName = "Arya";
const lastName = "Stark";
var knownAs = "no one";

function fullName(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
const name = fullName(firstName, lastName);
console.log(name);
Output: AryaStark
```

12. What will be the output of the following

```js
let firstName = "Arya";
const lastName = "Stark";
var knownAs = "no one";

function fullName(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
const name = fullName(firstName, lastName);
console.log(name);
Output: AryaStark
```

13. Guess the output of the code below with a reason.

```js
function sayHello() {
  let name = "Arya Stark";
}
sayHello();
console.log(name);
Output: <empty string>
Because the scope of let is in the sayHello function only.
```

14. Guess the output of the code below with a reason.

```js
if (true) {
  var name = "Arya Stark";
}
console.log(name);
Output: Arya Stark
Because 
```

15. Guess the output of the code below with a reason.

```js
if (true) {
  let name = "Arya Stark";
}
console.log(name);
Output: <empty string>
```

16. Guess the output of the code below with a reason.

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
  //
}
console.log(i);
Output: 20
Because the i is console logged outside the loop after the i is being incremented.

```

17. Guess the output of the code below with a reason.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
  //
}
console.log(i);
Output: i not defined. i is called outside the given scope hence, it can't work outside the scope.
```

18. Guess the output of the code below with a reason.

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i, "first"), 100);
}
console.log(i, "second");
Output: 
20 second 
20 first
Because of the timeout, the 20 second went in first and after 100milisecond, 20 first was executed 20 times.
```

19. Guess the output of the code below with a reason.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i, "first"), 100);
}
console.log(i, "second");
Output: 
i is not defined
0 first
1 first
2 first
3 first
4 first
5 first
6 first
7 first
8 first
9 first
10 first
11 first
12 first
13 first
14 first
15 first
16 first
17 first
18 first
19 first
Because of let, the scope of i is just in the for loop and not outside, hence the not defined error and then the for loop worked normally.
```

20. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
function sample() {
  if (true) {
    var username = "John Snow";
  }
  console.log(username);
}
Output: undefined
Because the username is console logged and the sample is never called.
```

21. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
function sample() {
  if (true) {
    let username = "John Snow";
  }
  console.log(username);
}
Output: undefined
Because the username is console logged and sample is never called.
```

22. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
function sample() {
  var username = "Arya Stark";
  if (true) {
    var username = "John Snow";
    console.log(username);
  }
  console.log(username, "second");
}
Output: undefined
Because the username is console logged and sample is never called.
```

23. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
function sample() {
  let username = "Arya Stark";
  if (true) {
    let username = "John Snow";
    console.log(username, "first");
  }
  console.log(username, "second");
}
Output: undefined
Because the username is console logged and sample is never called.
```

24. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
function sample(...args) {
  for (let i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
    let message = `Hello I am ${args[i]}`;
    console.log(message);
  }
}
sample("First", "Second", "Third");
Output: 
Hello I am First
Hello I am Second
Hello I am Third
Because the arguments passed are being inserted in the message one by one and then the message is console logged in the same scope.
```

25. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
function sample(...args) {
  for (let i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
    const message = `Hello I am ${args[i]}`;
    console.log(message);
  }
}
sample("First", "Second", "Third");
Output: 
Hello I am First
Hello I am Second
Hello I am Third
Because the arguments passed are being inserted in the message one by one and then the message is console logged in the same scope.
```

26. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
if (true) {
  const myFunc = function() {
    console.log(username, "Second");
  };
  console.log(username, "First");
  let username = "Hello World!";
  myFunc();
}
Output: can't access lexical declaration before initialization
```

27. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
function outer() {
  let movie = "Mad Max: Fury Road";
  function inner() {
    console.log(`I love this movie called ${movie.toUpperCase()}`);
  }
  inner();
}
outer();
Output: I love this movie called MAD MAX: FURY ROAD
There was an error with the back ticks, fixed it and then it works.

```

28. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
function outer() {
  let movie = "Mad Max: Fury Road";
  function inner() {
    let movie = "Before Sunrise";
    console.log("I love this movie called ${movie.toUpperCase()}");
  }
  inner();
}
outer();
Output: I love this movie called BEFORE SUNRISE
There was an error with the back ticks, fixed it and then it works.
Also the value of movie got changed when the inner function was called and then console logged.
```

29. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
function outer() {
  let movie = "Mad Max: Fury Road";
  function inner() {
    let movie = "Before Sunrise";
    function extraInner() {
      let movie = "Gone Girl";
      console.log("I love this movie called ${movie.toUpperCase()}");
    }
    extraInner();
  }
  inner();
}

outer();
Output: I love this movie called GONE GIRL
There was an error with the back ticks, fixed it and then it works.
Also the value of movie got changed when the extraInner function was called and then console logged.
```

30. Execute all the functions inside `allFunctions` variable using any loop. (Hint: use for of loop functions are object)

```js
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
const sub = (a, b) => {
  return a - b;
};
const multiply = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
const divide = (a, b) => {
  return a / b;
};

let allFunctions = [add, sub, multiply, divide];
Output:
```

31. You have to pass 10 and 12 as initial value and find the final output when you pass the return value of one function as an input to the next function in the array `allFunctions`.

```js
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
const sub = (a, b) => {
  return a - b;
};
const multiply = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
const divide = (a, b) => {
  return a / b;
};

let allFunctions = [add, add, add, add, add, sub, sub, multiply, divide];
```
